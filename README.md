## SPACESHIP DISASTER GAME
----------------------------------------------------------------
Your spaceship was hit by debris and has split in half! You can see the escape
pod drifting away, but you need supplies in order to fly there safely.
You will need to gather your spacesuit, helmet, oxygen tank, jetpack, battery pack,
and keys from different areas of your ship. Once you have your gear,
you will be able to exit the hull rupture in your ship and fly home.
If you enter the unpressurized area unprepared, you will lose.

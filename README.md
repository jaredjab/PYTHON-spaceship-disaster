## SPACESHIP DISASTER GAME
----------------------------------------------------------------
Your spaceship was hit by debris and has split in half! 
You can see the escape pod drifting away, but you need supplies in order to fly there safely.

From the ship, you will need to gather your:
- spacesuit
- helmet
- oxygen tank
- jetpack
- battery pack
- keys

Once you have your gear, you will be able to exit the hull rupture in your ship and fly home. 
If you enter the unpressurized area unprepared, you will lose.

Good Luck.
